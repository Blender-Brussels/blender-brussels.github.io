Ruben Blancquaert aka Nebeor, one of the member of Blender-Brussels, is a developer who likes to use Python to do some experimental modeling inside Blender.

We invite you to join us in this workshop to explore the possibilities of this procedural modeling tool.

While there is no Python programming required to follow this workshop, programmers will be invited into writing an custom node.

Have a look at the presentation video:

This workshop session will be held Saturday 14th of January, between 10:45am and 6 pm in the new F/LAT offices. There will be a lunch break between 14:00 and 15:00, so you know, in case you want to join at different times.


## Results of the day

One of the outputs is a custom python node that generates great [bouctje](http://libreobjet.org/objects/bouctje/project.html) models.

The script generates a 3d model and flat surfaces to build a construction plan. A little box info at the bottom render the real size of the side panel.

See video for a short demo:

## Info

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. Started by [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) and [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with code. It works as a communal space to exchange ideas and share knowledge as a way to learn.

All results of these practices − exercises and documentation produced during the workshop − are shared online under an open source license.

This event is hosted at [F/LAT asbl, 28-30 boulevard Albert II, World-Trade-Center Tower I, 25th floor](http://osm.org/go/0EoTliUnh-?m=) on Saturday 14th January 2017, **starting at 10:45 and finishing at 18:00**.
